          "Yes, there will be a questionnaire to record your shared post link. You will be screened before the launch and receive the upgraded $20 coupon if eligible on 11/10.\nYou can only receive one coupon per person; coupons cannot be combined.\nCoupons will be sent in batches on the launch day, with upgraded customers receiving $20 and others receiving $10."

          "You do not need to purchase through the official website.
